# iOS 12 &amp; Swift 4 Learning Portfolio

Xcode 10 & 11 & Swift 4.2 & 5. Includes ARKit2, CoreML2 and CreateML.
The project ideas in this porfolio are from [Angela Yu's bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview). I watch a few videos at the beginning to get familiar with Xcode and Swift. After that, I mainly just try to implement the apps on my own and check with Yu's solution if I get *really* stuck.
